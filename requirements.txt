# Use a NumPy version compatible with both llama-cpp-python and fastembed.
# The previous pin to NumPy 2.x conflicted with fastembed, which requires
# NumPy versions below 2. Pinning to the latest 1.x release resolves the
# dependency issues while remaining within the supported range of
# llama-cpp-python.
